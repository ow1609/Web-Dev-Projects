<h1>Onuora's Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>The classic summer holiday romance movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. My favourite line has to be, of course, "Nobody puts Baby in the Corner." My favourite scene is when Johnny Castle (Swayze) returns for the end of season dance and makes an inspiring speech about his girlfriend, and new dance partner, Baby.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Fugitive</h3>
<p>A truly brilliant film, starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, about one man's pursuit for justice and vindication after being falsely accused of his wife's murder. My favourite scene has to be when Dr Richard Kimble (Ford) comes face to face with Detective Samual Gerard (Jones) in a the waterworks system. Kimble protests his innocence, Gerard retorts, "I don't care," before Kimble leaps off a ledge down a huge damn into the waters to escape capture.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Terminator (1984)</h3>
<p>The iconic sci-fi film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The plot is conceptually fantastic referencing a distopian future whereby AI robots seek to wipe out humanity and have sent a "Terminator" to kill the leader of human resistance by killing his mother, Sarah Connor, before he's even conceived. The most famous line from this movie is "I'll be back". Although the visual effects have aged since the film was made, when I was a child, I used to be genuinely terrified of the Terminator.</p>
