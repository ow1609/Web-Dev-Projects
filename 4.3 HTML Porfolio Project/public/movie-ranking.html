<h1>Onuora's Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
<p>The classic romantic movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. My favourite line has to be, of course, "Nobody puts Baby in the Corner"</p>
<br />
<h3>The Fugitive</h3>
<p>A truly brilliant film, starring Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, about one man's pursuit for justice and vindication after being falsely accued of his wife's murder. My favourite scene has to be when Dr Richard Kimble (Ford) comes face to face with Detective Samual Gerard (Jones) in a the waterworks system. Kimble protests his innocence, Gerard retorts "I don't care" before Kimble leaps from a ledge down a huge damn into the waters to escape capture.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Terminator (1984)</h3>
<p>The iconic sci-fi film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The plot is conceptually fantastic referencing a distopian future whereby AI robots seek to wipe out humanity and have sent a "Terminator" to kill the leader of human resistance by killing his mother Sarah Conner before he's even born. The most famous line from this movie is "I'll be back". Although the visual effects have aged since the film was made, when I was a child, I used to be genuinely terrified of the Terminator.</p>
