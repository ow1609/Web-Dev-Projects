        <h2>Have fun. Grow in confidence. Achieve your potential.</h2>

        <p>
            At Wright Tuition, I am passionate about delivering high quality, accessible and inclusive education.
            This is why I offer significant discounts for students who experience socio-economic challenges 
            as I believe economic constraints should not limit how far you can progress in your education.
        </p>

        <h3>Discounts for disadvantaged students</h3>
        <p>
            I offer discounted rates for students whose socio-economic background puts them at a disadvantage. 
            A discount is offered on a case-by-case basis and upon proof of socio-economic circumstances and 
            cannot be back-dated or refunded from previous lessons but will be applied for all future lesson 
            bookings where the disadvantage persists.
        </p>

        <p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of example learners who may be eligible to discounted lessons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students who are in receipt of state benefits in their country of residence</li>
            <li>Students who come from an ethnic minority background</li>
            <li>
                Children who attend a UK government-funded school and are eligible to free school meals 
                beyond Year 2 (even if the child is not yet beyond Year 2)
            </li>
            <li>Refugees and asylum seekers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I exercise the utmost discretion when awarding discounted rates and discounted rates vary from case to case.</p>
        <p>
            As part of a the discount policy, it may be that you are only able to attend small group lessons and 
            may not be entitled to 1-2-1 tuition. However, please note that, for certain learning goals and 
            circumstances, small group classes can provide a more enriching learning experience than 1-2-1 tuition.
        </p>
