            Hi, I'm Onuora ( pronouned <i>Onora</i> ) Wright, the founder and lead teacher at Wright Tuition. 
            I'm delighted you're considering Wright Tuition's services. 
            I have a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). 
            For years, I have been a class teacher and subject leader in several primary and secondary 
            schools in the UK and I have taught overseas in both France and Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a private tutor, I specialise in primary, 11+ and GCSE Maths, English, French and Spanish. 
            For many years, I have tutored children and adult learners, helping them to grow in confidence 
            and achieve exam success and the qualifications they have needed for their next chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about inclusive education. As a child, I struggled with reading in school, 
            which negatively affected my confidence. I developed strong coping strategies which masked 
            the issue so it was not until I was an adult learner that I was diagnosed with learning 
            difficulties linked to dyslexia. I am a firm believer that neurodiversity can be a person's 
            superpower and strength and should not be viewed as a barrier to learning. Neurodiversity 
            simply means that a person learns in a different way to most people and therefore their education 
            needs to be adapted and delivered in a different way - a way that works for them. From my 
            extensive experience teaching students with a broad spectrum of learning needs and abilities, 
            I pride myself on my ability to adapt my teaching to suit individual learners' strengths and 
            learning styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, whether you're an adult looking to learn Spanish from scratch or you're a parent looking to 
            improve your child's confidence and Maths skills, you've come to the <strong><em></em>Wright</strong> place!
        </p>
