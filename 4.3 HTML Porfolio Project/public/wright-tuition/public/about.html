        <p>Hi, I'm Ms Wright and I'm delighted you're considering my tuition services. I have a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). For years, I have been a class teacher and subject leader in several primary and secondary schools in the UK and I have taught overseas in both France and Spain.</p>
        <p>As a private tutor, I specialise in primary, 11+ and GCSE Maths, English, French and Spanish. For many years, I have tutored children and adult learners, helping them to grow in confidence and achieve exam success and the qualifications they have needed for their next chapter.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about inclusive education. As a child, I struggled with reading in school, which affected my confidence. I developed coping strategies which masked the issue so it was not until I was an adult learner that I was diagnosed with learning difficulties linked to dyslexia. I am a firm believer that neurodiversity can be a person's superpower and strength and should not be viewed as a barrier to learning. Neurodiversity simply means that a person learns in a different way to most people and therefore their education needs to be adapted and delivered in a different way - a way that works for them. From my extensive experience teaching students with a broad spectrum of learning needs and abilities, I pride myself on my ability to adapt my teaching to suit individual learners' strengths and learning styles.</p>
        <p>So, whether you're an adult looking to learn Spanish from scratch or you're a parent looking to improve your child's confidence and Maths skills, you've come to the <strong><em></em>Wright</strong> place!</p>
