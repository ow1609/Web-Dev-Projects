        <p>Hi, I'm Ms Wright and I'm delighted you're considering my tuition services. I have a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). For over 8 years, I have been a class teacher and subject leader in several primary and secondary schools in the UK and I have also taught overseas in both France and Spain.</p>
        <p>As a private tutor, I will help you achieve your learning goals. I have extensive experience tutoring children and adults, leading them to achieve exam success and the qualifications they have needed for their next chapter. I specialise in 11+ and GCSE Maths, English, French and Spanish and have recently added Coding and Web Development to my teaching repertoire (I created the website you're reading now from scratch!).</p>
        <p>I am passionate that education unlocks the doors to a better future and I am a firm believer that the key to happiness is being a life-long learner, to continually develop, improve and broaden our minds.</p>
        <p>So, whether you're an adult looking to learn Spanish from scratch or you're a parent looking to improve your child's confidence and Maths skills, you've come to the <strong><em></em>Wright</strong> place!</p>
        
        <h4>My Teaching Style</h4>
        <!-- indivisually tailored, 1-2-1, groups, 2 - 4, games, online, challenges, goal-setting, learning to learn, confidence-buiding, breaking down large challenges into smaller steps -->
        <p></p>
