<h3>STORAGE:</h3>

<h4>Refrigerator:</h4>
<p>Store leftovers in the refrigerator, to ensure they remain fresh. They are super gooey and fudgy, so the chilled temperature will ensure they don't spoil. Consume within a few days if you manage not to gobble them up right awat in one sitting!</p>

<h4>Freezer:</h4>
<P>Wrap them in parchment paper individually, and place them in a ziplock bag and store them in the freezer. They will keep well frozen for up to 6 months. </P>
