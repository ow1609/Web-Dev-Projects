    <h2> Summary</h2>

    <p>
        After pairing with a friend to test-drive a fizz-buzz program, 
        I got the ‘bug’ for coding and a strong desire to switch to a career 
        in technology. After some initial self-study, I have successfully 
        completed software development courses. My work experience reflects 
        my passion for learning and helping others which motivates me to 
        work in technology where the opportunities for learning and helping 
        others are endless.
